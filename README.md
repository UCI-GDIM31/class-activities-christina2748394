r, g, and b are numbers between 0-1 which are usually not whole numbers. 
The bounce variable is used to record the number of times the ball hits a wall, which will always be a whole number.
The error shows a line is missing ";", which reminds me to add ";" after each line of code.

For the  method named DidPlayerHitBeat in a rhythm game, the input type should be 2 floats to get the time when the beat comes up and the time the player press hit.
The return type should be a boolean beacuse it need a true or false to indecate whether the player hit the object.

# metaphor
The class is like a recipe and components are what you can make with it, and the member variables are like ingredients and the methods are like the cooking steps.
